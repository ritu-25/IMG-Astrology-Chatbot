in anti clockwise direction as seen from the Northern celestial hemisphere . Its projection from the earth in Zodiac would look like in a way that it crosses the 1st sign , then enters the second sign , after crossing the 2nd sign , it enters the third one and after crossing each degree of the zodiac upto the 12th sign it enters again in the 1st sign . Planets including the nodes have varied rates of motion . The average daily angular motion of the planets which are not constant are as follows :
A planet has varied aspects with other planets . In Predictive Astrology the inter planetary longitudinal distances of the planets play important role for the prediction of effects .

7. Details of the conceptual framework and dispositions of stars be known through general literature of astrology . Now I tell about the effects of planets and signs . Notes : ‘ संज्ञा नक्षत्र वृन्दानां ज्ञेयाः सामान्य शास्त्र : ' It is obvious from this line that full knowledge about the dispostions of the stars is of great importance in prediction . Though Sage Parasara has not made Nakshatras the subject of study of this book ( Hora Shastra ) , he has given clear instructions to Maitreya that he should have proper knowledge about them . यस्मिन् काले यतः खेटा यान्ति दुग्गणितैकताम् । तत एव स्फुटाः कार्याः दिक्कालौ च स्फुटौ विदा ॥८ ॥ स्वस्वदेशोद्भवैः साध्यं लग्नं

influence on the fifth House of the planets , male , female and neuter The native has younger or elder brother or sister , this is also indicated on the basis of the sex of the planets . Thus the influence of Mars , Sun and Jupiter on the 3rd or 11th House will give the native the joy of having younger or elder brother and the influence of Venus and Moon will give him sister . In the horoscope the sex of the thief etc. is also known by the influence of the planets . The following example will easily explain the application of this Sutra . The date of birth of this native falls on 21.9.1952 , the time of birth as per Indian Standard Time is 19.00 hours and the latitude and longitude are 28 ° -43 ° , " 77 ° - 13 ' respectively . In the present Horoscope the Ascendant is Pisces . In the Seventh House are situated : Mercury , Saturn , Sun , Venus and
Moon . There is no other influence on this House . The Seventh House is related to sex and the planet Venus is the significator of sex . Here Venus is in her fall and has the combination of two impotent planets , viz Mercury and Saturn . Here the Sun is situated as the Lord of the 6th House , the House of diseases etc. In the combination of , and due to her nearness to the Sun , the Moon will also become a krura ( malefic ) planet . Here the greatest disadvantage is being caused to Venus because she is the significator planet of the 7th House . Due to Venus's combination with an impotent planet her sexual ability or potency has been completely destroyed . The same thing happened with this native .

Muhurtha One Muhurtha is of 2 gharis or 48 Minutes ( 1Ghari 24 Minutes ) some writers , out of illusion , have divided day duration into 15 parts and one part is regarded as Muhurtha . This has become a blind tradition and it is a very fatal tendency . This has been done by the religious essayists because , due to their ignorance of the mathematics of Time , they have made 15 divisions of the day duration and and have made Kutuya and Rantiya etc Muhurthas This is clearly unreasonable , because on our Earth , day duration goes on getting lesser or greater . What arrangement will these essayists make at such places . Therefore , the muhurtha must be regarded as a period of 2 gharis . The Lord of Muhurtha is the Moon . Ahoratra ( Day and Night ) .Duration of a day and a night is termed as Ahoratra i.e. 24 hrs or 60 gharis make an Ahoratra . Its Lord is Mars .
Ritu ( Seasons ) The Ritus are six
Therefore , Ritu is of about two months , because Ritu is the time taken by the Sun in crossing two signs The Lord of Ritu is Mercury . Masa : The time from one sunrise to another sunrise is called one sawan day . In the same way 30 sawan days make one Sawan Masa . Its Lord is Mercury . Paksha Paksha is equal to the half of the Sawan Masa . From Shukla Pratipada ( the first day of the Moon rise ) to Amavasya

The horoscope , given to illustrate verse 56 , in the notes , is to be re - examined . The 5 fold relationship as per this formula will be obtained in the following way . 5 Fold Relationship or Compound Relationship
Here in the temporary relationship Mars and Jupiter are friendly and they are also friendly in the natural relationship . Therefore , Mars and Jupiter are extremely friendly . The Moon is enemy in the temporary relationship and friendly in the natural relationship ; therefore , the Moon is neutral to the Sun. Mercury is enemy in temporary relationship and neutral in natural relationship ; therefore , Mercury remains enemy to the Sun. Again , Venus and Saturn are enemy in temporary relationship and they are enemy in the natural relationships . Therefore , these two planets become extreme enemy to the Sun.

59-60 Ratio of Effects : When in his exaltation , a planet gives fully good effects , in his Mool Trikona sign , three fourth or 75 % , in his own sign half or 50 % , in his friendly sign one fourth or 25 % , in the sign of his neutral planet half of one fourth or 12.5 % and when he is in his fall , or is set or is in enemy house , it should be predicted by the wise astrologer that his effects are nil . Inauspicious effects are quite reverse with reference to these houses . Notes : This verse may be shown in table form in the following way :

day time ) on which Gulika is to be determined . For example , if we have to know the Gulika on Sunday in the day time , the Lord of the first portion will be the Sun , that of the second Moon , of the third Mars , of the Fourth Mercury , of the 5th Jupiter , of the sixth Venus and of the 7th Saturn . The 8th portion will be Lordless . Therefore , on this day , the seventh portion of the Dinmana is the portion of Gulika . If the Gulika of the day of Mercury is to be known , then the Lord of the first portion will be Mercury , that of the Second Jupiter , of the 3rd Venus , of the 4th Saturn , of the 5th Sun , of the 6th Moon and of the 7th Mars . On Wednesday , in the day time , Saturn , is the Lord of the 4th portion , therefore the Lord of the fourth portion is Gulika . In the same way , Saturn's portion of all the other days will be considered as the portion of Gulika . But when the time of birth falls in the night the portion of Gulika is arrived at by a different method . In that case the night duration ( Ratrimana ) is divided by 8 . Then the Lord of the 5th day from the day of birth is taken to be the Lord of the First portion . Counting in this way respectively , the Gulika of the night of birth will be that portion the Lord of which is Saturn . To know the Gulika of the night of Sunday , the Ratrimana ( night duration ) is to be divided by 8. The Lord of the First portion will be Jupiter instead of the Sun , for he is the 5th from the Sun. In the same way , the Lord of the 2nd will be Venus , that of the 3rd Saturn and so on . The 8th portion is Lordless in the night too . In this way on the night of Sunday the portion of Gulika falls on the 3rd portion of Ratrimana ( night duration ) Lord of the Portion of Day's Gulika

Lord of the Portion of Night's Gulika
Gulika - Dhruvanka ( CONSTANT )
The method of preparing Gulika lagna may be described in
this way :
The number of that portion , the Lord of which is Saturn , is the Dhruvanka . The 8th portion of the day or the night is mulitplied by that number ( Dhruvanka ) and the time arrived at by multiplying it is the time of Lagna spashta ( Longitude of the Ascendant ) Whatever the Lagnaspashta comes in this way will be the Lagnaspashta of the Gulika . It should be noted here that if the time of birth is the day , the Gulika spashta is found out at that time which is arrived at by multiplying by the 8th portion , while , if the time of birth is night , the Ratrimana is divided by 8 and the number arrived at is multplied by the Dhruvanka of the Lord of the day and is added to the day duration ( Dinmana ) .
==
For instance , the Dinmana ( Day duration is 33 ghatis and 52 palas ; 1 ghati = 60 palas , 1 ghati = 24 Minutes ) . Deduce Dinmana from 60 ghati , it gives Ratrimana ( The total mana of day and night is 60 Ghatis ) .

and Ketu ) and in retrograde planets the process is reversed and is made positive negative . Then the planets of that time will be clear . Notes : In the old almanacs the planetary position was given of midnight each after eight days . This is called Pankti . Some Astrologers call it Prastaar also . Along with planetary positions the planetary movement is also given . The difference between the Ishta Kaala and Mishra Kaala is called Chaalana . This Chaalana is either Aishya ( + ) or Yaata ( - ) . If the Ishta Kaala is of time before the Mishra Kaala , then the Chaalana is negative ( Yaata Sanjaka ) ; and if the Ishta Kaala is of the time after the Mishra Kaala , then the Chaalana is positive ( Aishya Sanjaka ) ; because if the Ishta Kaala is of the time before the Mishra Kaala , then the planetary position of the Ishta Kaala will be arrived at by deducting from the planets of the Pankti Kaala ; and if it is of the time after the Mishra Kaala then the planetary position of the Ishta Kaala will be arrived at by adding in the planets of Pankti Kaala . But in the case of the retrograde planets the process is reversed . In the almanacs the Pankti of the Mishra maana Kaala is given in the following manner . The Ishta of Planets on 8 ( Ashtami ) Monday 28-5-1951 . Mishramaana Kala 47-04
Suppose the birth of the native occurred on Jyeshta Krishna Trayodashi Samvata 2008. Date of birth 2-6-1951 , Place of birth Hapur . The Sawaneshta or Ishta Kaala of the time of birth is 44 Ghati , 32 Pala and 20 Vipala . The day number of Saturday is Seven . Therefore , the Ishta Kaala may be called 7-44-32-20 day , Ghati etc. Pankti is of Monday dated 28-5-1951 . Therefore , the Ishta Kaala of the Planets of Pankti will be 2-47-04 day ghati etc. Here the Ishta Kaala is more than the Pankti Kaala . Therefore , Pankti Kaala is

Drekkana : If in a horoscope the third house is occupied by a male sign , the Lord of the third house is situated in a male sign , there are male planets in the third house and the third house is aspected by male planets and Mars who is the significator of younger brother is also strong , then this combination gives younger brother to the native . If the Drekkana Ascendant and the third house from this ascendant has also all these conditions , then it can be predicted with certainty that the native will be blessed with a younger brother . The younger brother's health , habits or nature and longevity may also be correctly guessed The presence of the Lord of the Drekkana Ascendant , the Lord of the third house from the Drekkana Ascendant together and Mars getting Vimshopaka strength in between 15 and 20 Vishwa , is a positive point . The use of Drekkana is made in Predictive Astrology extensively in a number of things , the exhaustive description of which has been made in our Book ' Parasara and the Sixteen Divisions ' . It will not be out of place to give here some additional information The Drekkana ( Decanate ) has some peculiar names such as 1. Ayudha Drekkana : It is as follows in various signs :

Drekkanas should be considered necessarily when starting on a journey . Thus , if Ayudha Drekkana is situated with or is aspected by malefic planets , journey should not be made in the Ayudha Drekkana because its effect will be litigation , defeat in Test Matches and competitions . The effect of the situation or aspect of benefic planets in this Drekkana signifies triumph . Making journey in Sarpa ( Bhujanga ) Drekkana or in Nigada ( Pasha ) Drekkana results in getting the native arrested . The beginning of the case under Article 302 or Verdict ( judgement ) of the case in the Pasha Drekkana means getting death punishment by hanging . If there is the Chatushpada Drekkana and it has the aspect of malefic planets , it causes death of the cattle in the native's house . There should be no purchase of cattle in such Drekkana .
Effects of Drekkanas :
All the Drekkanas have their own peculiar features or qualities which are used in knowing the features of a thief .

26 27. Vimshopaka Proportional Evaluation : When the Vimshopaka Bala of all the Vargas is multiplied by the Vimshopaka Bala ( varga vishwa ) mentioned in the house varga of extreme friend etc and is divided by 20 , it gives the exact Vimshopaka Bala or strength to predict the effect of all the vargas . It it is below 5 then it is not capable of giving auspicious results ; if it is above 5 but below 10 , the planet gives some auspicious effect , it being 10 to 15 the auspicious effect will be mediocre and , wholly favourable result will be yielded if it is 15 to 20 . Notes : All the Vargas ( Shadavarga , Saptavarga , Dashavarga and Shodasavarga ) have 20 Vimshopaka or 20 point strength . For easy grasp these are tabulated as below :

This table makes it clear that in the shadavarga the Lagna gets 6 points , Hora 2 , Drekkana 4 , Navamamsha 5 , Dvadashamsha 2 and Trimshamsha 1. This point ( strength ) which Lagna , Hora etc. get is called Swavishwa . For example , in Shadavargas Hora gets two Swavishwa . The strength which a planet gets when he is situated in extreme friends ' freind's and his own house is called Varga Vishwa . The formula given below is used in order to arrive at the Vimshopaka .
