      "text": "PREFACE\nIt is a matter of great pleasure that the publication of the\nsecond edition of JATAKA PARIJATA, the monumental\nwork of Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshita with the excellent notes of\nthe Late V. Subramanya Sastri has been possible by God's\ngrace and the same is being placed before the public. This is\nan exact reprint of the edition that was brought out by Shri\nSastri in the year 1932. No words of introduction are required\nas the works of Sh. Sastri are all masterpieces by themselves.\nand have rightly earned the fame that is their due. The earlier\nedition was long out of print and there was an ever growing\ndemand for this book and the present edition is intended to\nfulfill this long-felt demand.\nThe importance of this work Jataka Parijata cannot be\nexaggerated. It is a basic text book of Hindu Astrology, studied\nalmost in all parts of the country by students and scholars\nalike. It is a book invariably prescribed for study in almost\nall oriental examinations on Jyotisha. As a classical text book\nof Hindu Astrology it ranks next perhaps only to Brihat Jata-\nka. The fact remains that Brihat Jataka is too brief and\ndifficult and that was why works like Horasara, Saravali etc.\nwere written with a view to supply all that is obscure, hidden\nand missing therein. Among these works is none. that\ncan excel Jataka Parijata in providing a detailed knowledge\nabout all the essential aspects like Ayurdaya, yogas, Bhava-\nphala, Vimshottari, Ashtakvarga, Stri Jataka, Kalachakra\nDasha etc. The work has been translated in most of the regional\nlanguages like Malayalam, Hindi etc and is held in high\nesteem by astrologers as a book of great authority throughout\nthe country\nत्रिस्कन्धं ज्योतिषं होरा गणितं संहितेति च ॥\n(Parasa a)\nThe science of Jyotisha, according to tradition is divided\ninto three parts-Hora (predictive), Ganitha (Mathematical)\nand Samhita (Miscellaneous) Predictive.

It is\nunderstood from the quotations found in commentaries that\nthere existed large volumes of Horas called after Parasara,\nBrihat Prajapatya, Saunaka, Kaushika, Atri, Garga etc. Today\nmany of these have become rare and almost inaccessible.\nLater works like Brihat Jataka and Jataka Parijata etc. are all\ncondensations of these Horas as they themeselves profess to be.\nIn the opening two verses the author says:\nनत्वा गर्ग पराशरादिरचितं सङगृह्य होराफलम् ।\nसङ्ग्रह्य सारावलिमुख्यतंन्त्र करोम्यहं जातक पारिजातम् ॥\nFrom this statement it is clear that the author is summą-\nrising all that is important in the ancient Horas of Garga,\nParasara etc. and the later works like Brihat Jataka, Saravali\netc. And at the end he writes:\nहो सिन्धुसमुद्धतामृतमयी मष्टावशाध्यायिनीम् ।\nað aias qifeanaazfm stateys salfwałą 11\nगीतोत्सुक श्लोकिनीम् ॥\ni. e. this work is divided into 18 chatpers and is supposed to\ncontain a 1763 slokas. But, the work contains in the\npresent form 1918 slokas due to interpolations. Many slokas\nare verbatim borrowed from the ancient works like Saravali,\nBrihat Jataka etc. Works like Phaladeepika etc. are indebted\nto this reat work which fact is clear from the slokas that are\n!\nfound in them, borrowed from this book. eg. mzaz¾ etc.\nThe Subject Matter\nThe topics dealt with in the X V III Adhyayas are briefly\nas follows:\n1.\nNature of the signs. 2. Nature of the planets. 3.\nBirth of beasts and miscellaneous. 4. Arishta-Infantile death\netc. 5. Ayurdaya-Longevity. 6. Evil combinations that mar\nthe horoscopes 7. Rajayogas. 8. Combination of two or more\nPlanets. 9. Effects of Mandi, year, month etc of birth. 10.\nAshtavarga. 11. Results of I and II houses. 12. Results of III\nand IV houses 13. Results of V and VI houses. 14. Results\nof VII, VIII and IX houses. 15. Results of X, XI and XII\nbouses. 16 Female Horoscopy. 17. Kalachakra Dasha.",

But this deserves further investigation and the\nsuggestion appears to be incondusive. The suggestion that the\nauthor was indentical with the writer of the celebrated work\n'Prataparadriya' on poestics, is totally incorrect, for the latter\nwas Vidyanatha (fur), the confusion being due to the\nunfortunate similarity in spelling. The appellation Dikshita'\nclearly denotes that he must have performed some big sacrifices\nof the type ‘Somayaga' etc.\nThe author belonged to South India and most probably\nto Karnataka or Andhrapradesh.\nProf. Katva has stated that he belonged to the 14th cen-\ntury and lived in Mysore. As far as we could gather, the\nfamily tree is as follows:--\nAnniah Dikshita\nVenkatadri (Venkatesa Dikshita)\nVaidyanatha Dikshita\nIf any further details are known to he readers, they are\nrequested to send them to us so that the same can be added for\nthrowing more light about the author of this great work.",

D. Hence Vaidyanatha should have been born between 1425\nA. D. and 1450 A.D\nThe Translation\nIt is hardly necessary to dwell upon the merits of this\ntranslation as the works of Shri Sastri are too well known to the\npublic for their remarkable clarity erudition and thoroughness.\nThe reader will find that all available parallel passages (more\nthan about a thousand slokas) from authentic works have been\nfreely and fully quoted almost perhaps to superfluity so that\nthe book will serve as a self contained and useful compendium\non the subject.\nIf this book should be received by all the readers interes-\nted in this science of Astrology with interest and should it\nprove useful to our readers, we will consider ourselves amply\nrewarded for our labour.\nTHE PUBLISHERS",
