PREFACE
It is a matter of great pleasure that the publication of the
second edition of JATAKA PARIJATA, the monumental
work of Sri Vaidyanatha Dikshita with the excellent notes of
the Late V. Subramanya Sastri has been possible by God's
grace and the same is being placed before the public. This is
an exact reprint of the edition that was brought out by Shri
Sastri in the year 1932. No words of introduction are required
as the works of Sh. Sastri are all masterpieces by themselves.
and have rightly earned the fame that is their due. The earlier
edition was long out of print and there was an ever growing
demand for this book and the present edition is intended to
fulfill this long-felt demand.
The importance of this work Jataka Parijata cannot be
exaggerated. It is a basic text book of Hindu Astrology, studied
almost in all parts of the country by students and scholars
alike. It is a book invariably prescribed for study in almost
all oriental examinations on Jyotisha. As a classical text book
of Hindu Astrology it ranks next perhaps only to Brihat Jata-
ka. The fact remains that Brihat Jataka is too brief and
difficult and that was why works like Horasara, Saravali etc.
were written with a view to supply all that is obscure, hidden
and missing therein. Among these works is none. that
can excel Jataka Parijata in providing a detailed knowledge
about all the essential aspects like Ayurdaya, yogas, Bhava-
phala, Vimshottari, Ashtakvarga, Stri Jataka, Kalachakra
Dasha etc. The work has been translated in most of the regional
languages like Malayalam, Hindi etc and is held in high
esteem by astrologers as a book of great authority throughout
the country
त्रिस्कन्धं ज्योतिषं होरा गणितं संहितेति च ॥
(Parasa a)
The science of Jyotisha, according to tradition is divided
into three parts-Hora (predictive), Ganitha (Mathematical)
and Samhita (Miscellaneous) Predictive. Astrology was origi-

nally written by the ancient sages in the form of works called
HORAS. These were very voluminous and detailed and a
study thereof was very difficult and time-consuming. It is
understood from the quotations found in commentaries that
there existed large volumes of Horas called after Parasara,
Brihat Prajapatya, Saunaka, Kaushika, Atri, Garga etc. Today
many of these have become rare and almost inaccessible.
Later works like Brihat Jataka and Jataka Parijata etc. are all
condensations of these Horas as they themeselves profess to be.
In the opening two verses the author says:
नत्वा गर्ग पराशरादिरचितं सङगृह्य होराफलम् ।
सङ्ग्रह्य सारावलिमुख्यतंन्त्र करोम्यहं जातक पारिजातम् ॥
From this statement it is clear that the author is summą-
rising all that is important in the ancient Horas of Garga,
Parasara etc. and the later works like Brihat Jataka, Saravali
etc. And at the end he writes:
हो सिन्धुसमुद्धतामृतमयी मष्टावशाध्यायिनीम् ।
að aias qifeanaazfm stateys salfwałą 11
गीतोत्सुक श्लोकिनीम् ॥
i. e. this work is divided into 18 chatpers and is supposed to
contain a 1763 slokas. But, the work contains in the
present form 1918 slokas due to interpolations. Many slokas
are verbatim borrowed from the ancient works like Saravali,
Brihat Jataka etc. Works like Phaladeepika etc. are indebted
to this reat work which fact is clear from the slokas that are
!
found in them, borrowed from this book. eg. mzaz¾ etc.

18. Vimshottari Dasha and other Types of Dashas, Hundreds
of yogas are dealt with in chapters VI, VII and VIII and
such a detailed treatment is difficult to come across elsewhere.
Each chapter is comprehensive book by itself and it is for the
.reader to verify for himself the contents.
THE AUTHOR
Not much is known about the author except that he was
the son of a great scholar Venkatadri and belonged to the
Bharadwaja Gotra as he himself says =
sit faurfum àgufaaau: sit daarageît: i
भारद्वाज कुलोद्भवस्य विदुवः श्री वैजयहरिह |
värfasmteafaazeeq aau: »ñásma: gat: 11
from the abundancy of quotations found from the work
'Sarvartha Chintamani,' some opine that father of Vaidyanatha
Dikshita is none other than Venkatesa the author of 'Sarvartha
Chintamani'. But this deserves further investigation and the
suggestion appears to be incondusive. The suggestion that the
author was indentical with the writer of the celebrated work
'Prataparadriya' on poestics, is totally incorrect, for the latter
was Vidyanatha (fur), the confusion being due to the
unfortunate similarity in spelling. The appellation Dikshita'
clearly denotes that he must have performed some big sacrifices
of the type ‘Somayaga' etc.
The author belonged to South India and most probably
to Karnataka or Andhrapradesh.
Prof. Katva has stated that he belonged to the 14th cen-
tury and lived in Mysore. As far as we could gather, the
family tree is as follows:--
Anniah Dikshita
Venkatadri (Venkatesa Dikshita)
Vaidyanatha Dikshita
If any further details are known to he readers, they are
requested to send them to us so that the same can be added for
throwing more light about the author of this great work.

His Time
The author has been declared by Kesava Daivajna, as his
guru, which fact is borne out by the following sloka in his work
मुहूर्त तस्व
sulfasameauguniangagzzolgiaza ag
व्याप्यलयं गुरुवंद्यनाथचरण द्वन्द्वरतः केशवः
¶¶¶ Ganesa- Daivajna, the son of Kesava Daivajna
wrote his famous treatise Graha Laghava () in 1520
A. D. (Keshava belonged to Nandigram (f) in Mahar-
shtra) which is clear from the verse:
नन्दिग्राम इहापरान्त विषये शिष्यादिगीत स्तुति
afsyzglfogána: Ahamzará fag haa: 11
- ग्रह लाघव
So, Kesava Daivajna must have been born about 1456
A. D. Hence Vaidyanatha should have been born between 1425
A. D. and 1450 A.D
The Translation
It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the merits of this
translation as the works of Shri Sastri are too well known to the
public for their remarkable clarity erudition and thoroughness.
The reader will find that all available parallel passages (more
than about a thousand slokas) from authentic works have been
freely and fully quoted almost perhaps to superfluity so that
the book will serve as a self contained and useful compendium
on the subject.
If this book should be received by all the readers interes-
ted in this science of Astrology with interest and should it
prove useful to our readers, we will consider ourselves amply
rewarded for our labour.

The author presumes in the student an elementary know-
ledge of the science, such as the names of the 12 Rasis, the 27
Nakshatras, efc., and begins to give the different names by which
each of the signs is known.
In slokas 18 to 25 the Rasis have been more elaborately'dealt
with, but the following from Skandahora (1) may be noted
here regarding Vrishabha (чч) and other Rasis:

Sloka 7 (quarters 3 to 4 ) Kriya (क्रिय) and other
zodiacal signs in the heavens consist of nine quarters
of stars reckoning from Dasra (Aswini) and are
termed Kshetra (क्षेत्र), Riksha (ऋक्ष), Rasi (राशि), Bhavana
(भवन) and Bha (भ).
NOTES
Rasis are usually counted from Mesha and Nakshatras from
Aswini (अश्विनी). Each Nakshatra has four quarters and each Rasi
consists of nine quarters of the Nakshatras. Thus Mesha is com-
posed of Aswini (अश्विनी), Bharani ( भरणी) and the first quarter of
Krithika (कृत्तिका ) and so on. cf. Garga (गर्ग)

Sloka. 13. The signs Mesha, Vrishabha and
Kumbha are short. Makara, Mithuna, Dhanus, Meena
and Kataka are of even length while Vrischika, Kanya,
Simha and Thula are long. The signs are male and
female:from Mesha onwards in regular order. Mesha,
Vrishabha, Mithuna and Kataka with their thrikona
or triangular signs represent the four quarters commenc-
ing from the East. Again, the signs from Mesha, taken
in order, are to be considered fierce and auspicious ;
they are also termed moving, fixed and dual signs
respectively.
Nores.
This sloka is helpful in deciding the sex, appearance, charac-
her, etc., of the person concerned. If the Lagna be a male sign
and the surroundings lead to the same conclusion, he is surely a
male; but if they should be otherwise, he will be a male with
feminine appearance and character, etc., or vice versa, The
student should never venture any prediction unless all the existing
conditions are fully and carefully tested and weighed. अत्र पुरुषस्त्री-

According to the Yavanas, the lords of the Horas and

आद्या तु होरा भवनस्य पत्युरेकादश क्षेत्रपतेद्वितीया ।
स्वद्वादशैकादशराशिपानां द्रेष्काणसंज्ञाः क्रमशयोऽत ॥
so that, according to this view, the ownership of the Horas is
not restricted to the Sun and the Moon, but is shared by all
the planets. But this view of the Yavanas is not recognised
by Varahamihira, nor even by authorities like Satya who has
thus stated.

Thus, for example, the Sapthamamsas of Thula, an odd sign,
will begin with Thula and end with Mesha, while those of
Vrischika, an even sign, will count from Vrishabha (=the 7th sign
reckoned from Vrischika) and close with Vrischika. The magni-

Sapthamamsas are useful to ascertain the character or tem-

Navamsa is the first Navamsa in a moveable sign, the
middlemost in a fixed sign, and the last in a dual sign.

It will be seen that the Vargottama ( वर्गोत्तम) Navamsas in the
several Rasis bear the same names as the signs themselves. For
example, the first Navamsa ( नवांश) of Mesha is Mesha: the first of

Sloka 36. The Shodasamsas
The Shodasamsas (or th
portions of a sign are important. Their lords in the
case of an odd sign are Brahma (*), Vishnu (f),
Hara (₹) and Ravi (fa) recurring in regular order.
When the Lagna is an even sign, the lords of the
Shodasamsas (a) are to be counted in the inverse
order from Bhaskara (e) or Ravi (fa)
Notes.
The Shodasamsas () are thus described in the following

The Shodasamsa () division of the zodiacal sign is
variously known as Kalamsa (ši), Nripamsa (₹), and so on.
By this mode of division, the ecliptic is cut up into. 192 equal
segments of 1° 52' 30" each in length. The segments are named
in regular consecution, in the order of the zodiacal signs, so that
the initial segment of the sign Aries takes on the name of that
sign, that of the sign Taurus assumes the name of Leo, and so
forth. The segment rulers are, in the case of the positive signs
Brahma (), Vishnu (f), Rudra () and Aditya () in
rotation. In the case of the negative signs, the enumeration of
rulership is reversed. f. Parasara (quat)

But according to some, the count of the segments in the case
of an odd sign must follow the order of the zodiacal signs com
mencing from Aries and be supplemented in the end by the
names Brahma (u), Vishnu (ſ), Rudra (₹) and Aditya (A)
to make up the number 16. If the sign is even, the order of enu-
meration is to be reversed. According to this system, the positive
and negative signs are distinguished by the possession of a common
disposition of segments.
•
There are some others whose views are also marshalled
below for convenience of reference.
(I). If the sign under segmentation is positive, the count of the
segments must follow the order of the zodiacal signs commencing
from that sign (as in the case of the segmentation), and be
supplemented in the end by the names of the planets, Saturn,
Mercury, Mars, and the Sun, to make up the number 16. When
the sign is negative, the order of the count is reversed.
(2). The method of allocation of the segments is the same as in
the previous system; only, in place of the four planets, Saturn,
Mercury, Mars, and the Sun, the names of the divinities mentioned
with reference to the first method are put in.
(3). The method of allocation of the segments is in no wise
different from that of (2) above, except for the circumstance that
in place of the divinities we substitute the names of the 9th, 10th,
11th and 12th signs counted from the positive signs (under seg-
mentation. When the sign under segmentation is negative, the
order of naming is, of course, as usual, reversed. This scheme
has a certain amount of symmetry about it, as it provides not only
for rulers though not wholly planetary, but also for zodiacal names
of all segments.
The word f(in the 2nd line)=. These two words are
used in astrological classics not only in the general sense of
'Ascendant' but also (as here) in that of 'a given sign or house' or
a sign cr house under consideration, or from which a count has to
be made for a specific purpose.'

The predictive value of the () segmentation is, as may
be expected, involved in considerable obscurity. in the absence
of any consensus of testimony among astrological authors
as to the affinities of the several segments with the signs and
the planets. And the sad part of it is that reputable authors
like Varahamihira ( वराहमिहिर), Kalyanavarman (कल्याणवर्मन) and Bala-
bhadra () have nothing to say about the Shodasamsa in
their works.
An ingenious interpretation of this somewhat obscure variant
of the verse has been offered by Mr. T. V. Sarma of Tanjore on
the authority (as he tells me) of Pandit C. Saptarshi Sastry of
Tanjore.
"
' In an odd sign, the lords of the Shodasamsas or the sixteen
sub-divisions are those of the twelve signs reckoned from that
sign onward, together with those of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th
signs from the same sign. In an even sign, the lords are to be
counted in the reverse order from the 12th sign.
-
Notes In an odd sign, the first twelve sub-divisions are ruled
by the lords of the twelve signs beginning from that sign and the
remaining four sub-divisions are respectively ruled by the lords.
of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th signs counted from the same sign.
In an even sign on the other hand, the first four sub-divisions are
respectively governed by the lords of the 12th, 11th, 10th and 9th
signs from that sign and the remaining sub-divisions are respecti-
vely ruled by the lords of the twelve signs but counted in the
reverse order.
It is a peculiarity of our ancient Hindu authors to denote
numbers by the two well-known notation known as the Kata-
payadi (q), and the Arnavadi (f), Sankhyas. The words
Virinchi (fat), Sauri (f), Isa(), and Diwakara (f), are used
in accordance with the latter Sankhya.
Virinchi (af) or Brahman () represents 9 (the Praja-
patis, Marichi, (), Bhrigu (), Angiras (H), Pulasthya
(yea), Pulaha, (ge), Kratu (g), Daksha (4), Athri (×) and
Vriddhavasishta ( ववृद्धवसिष्ठ ).
Souri (af) or Vishnu (f) represents 10 (the 10 Avataras).
Isa () stands for 11 the 11 Rudras, and Diwakara (f¶¶)
for 12 (the 12 Adityas)."

Apart
But this interpretation presents certain difficulties.
from syntactical objections, the compound Virinchi Saurisadivaka-
raha (विरिचिशरशिदिवाकराः) will not bear a inumerical interpretation
as neither the Phaladeepika () nor the Sarwarttha Chinta-
mani (सर्वार्थचिन्तामणिः ), nor even Parasara (पराशर) varies the names of
the divinities into those of any other denomination .g. Nanda (π),
Dik (f), and the like, as they could have done if they had the
Arnavadi Sankhya () in view. If numbers were in their
mind, one or other of our ancient authors would have ordinary
Sankhya Vachaka Subanthaha (a). It is unfortunate
that Balabhadra (√), such a copious author in other respects,
does not so much as even mention the Shodasainsa (a) in his
Horaratna (R). Had he chosen to introduce the topic, it would
have put an end to all trouble.
The word Vilagne' (f) in the second half of the sloka
should be read with Oje () in first line also. Vilagne f
can only mean the 'rising sign'. The verse as a whole considers the
possibility of a 'rising sign' being 'positive, or negative, or male
or female, as they are termed in Western Astrology. The lines
quoted above from Parasara (TR) tend to confirm this view and
the interpretation as given in the translation is almost near the
mark. But Phaladeepika (1) and Sarwarttha Chintamani
(सर्वार्थचिन्तमणि) interpret the allocation of the Shodasamsa ( पोडशांश)
rulerships differently. On that account, the language of Jataka-
parijata (aa) cannot be forced to bear a meaning which it's
author did not evidently intend. Jatakaparijata () and
Parasara (qt go a good, way together as regards Shodasamsa.

Each of the planets other than the Sun and the Moon own
two signs one odd and the other even. When a planet is in
an odd sign, then take the odd Thrimsamsa Rasi (त्रिंशांश राशि) of
the planet in whose Thrimsamsa (त्रिंशांशा) the first planet lies.
Thus, a planet in an odd sign in a Guru Trimsamsa (गुरु त्रिंशांश)
must be placed in the Thrimsamsa Kundali (त्रिंशांश कुण्डली ) in Dhanus
(धनुम् ) ( an odd sign) and not in Neepa (मीन), while a planet in an
even sign in Guru Trimsamsa ( गुरु त्रिंशांश) must be placed in Meena
(मीन).

Sloka. 55. Eminent professors of Astrology say
that the 3rd, 11th, 6th and the 10th houses are Upachaya
(signs of increase or growth) houses. The remaining
houses, viz. the 9th, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 12th and the
1st are houses of suffering. These houses if occupied or
aspected by their several lords, or by Budha, Sukra or
Guru, but unoccupied and unaspécted by the rest, pro-
duce auspicious effects in respect to a birth, or to a per-
son making a query.
NOTES,
First half. In the opinion of some eminent astrologers like
Garga, the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th houses cease to be. Upacha
houses if they are aspected by malefic or other inimical planete

That is, the term Upachaya ( उपचय) is applied to the 3rd, 6th
10th, and 11th houses provided they are not aspected by malefics
or by planets inimical to the lords of those houses. But this
view is not accepted by Varahamihira (वराहमिहिर) He would
have those houses always as Upachaya ones. And in this, he is
supported by Satya and Yavaneswara

As the whole zodiac is passed over in 24 hours, each degree
is finished in 24/360x60x60 or 240 seconds or 240 / 24 or 10

Thus it is seen that the several measurements mentioned in
the sloka in the text when multiplied by 10 give the Chashakas
(200, 240, 280 &c. in time) of the several signs. These figures
are useful in finding out the relative lengths of the several parts
of a human body (see Adhyaya III, sloka 76).

NATURE OF THE PLANETS AND THEIR PROPERTISH.

the Moon, his mind; Kuja, his strength; Budha, his
speech Guru, the essence of all his knowledge and
happiness; Venus, his desire or lusts and Saturn, his
.misery.
NOTES,
In the notes to sloka 8 of Adhyaya I, the several parts of
Kalapurusha ( कालपुरुष ) beginning with the head were stated to be
counted from Mesha and those of the owner of a horoscope from
the Lagna. This is so far as the external appearance, etc. of the
several parts of the body are concerned. Now the inherent
qualities of the person are to be ascertained from the planets,
These planets are then known as Karakas (कारकाः) and appertain
to the owner of the horoscope just in the same way as they do to
the Kalapurusha.

The several constituents of Kalapurusha ( कालपुरुष ) will be
strong or weak in proportion to the strength of the several planets
representing them. But Saturn is an exception.
"
" शनौ बालनि दुःखाभावः अबले दुःखप्राबल्यम् ” When Saturn is strong,
there is less of misery; when he is weak, misery predominates.
of सारावली

and the effects of these qualities will reveal themselves during
the dasa periods of the planets concerned.
By the word used in the text and translated as "happi-
ness' both wealth and "progeny are also to be understood in addi-
tion to health and knowledge. For it is said

वरपत्यमप्युच्यते । पुत्रजन्मविपत्तिभ्यां न परं सुखदुःखयो: । There is no
greater happiness or misery than the birth or death of one's
child.
Jupiter is therefore the giver of health, wealth, progeny and
that is why his association and aspect are said to be extremely.

By the word 'association" used above, occupation of the planet's
house is also to be understood. This will be explained in

When the length of day or night is 30 ghatikas, the position

The position of Dhuma is found by adding 4 signs, 13 degrees,
20 minutes to the figures for the Sun. Substract Dhuma from 12
signs. The result is Vyathipatha. This increased by 6 signs!
becomes Parivesha or Paridhi. When Parivesha again is subtract*
ed from 12 signs, we get Indrachapa. Add to this 16 degrees, 40
minutes; Kethu is obtained. Kethu increased by one sign will
give the figures for the Sun.

Dhanus, Karmuka and Chapa are all synonyms.

Six of these (Mandi, Dhuma, Paridhi, Kodanda, Pata and
Upaketu) however appear to have been specially noticed. The

( वृद्धिचंद्र), Jupiter or Venus he is a benefic. When he is alone, he
is more a benefic than a malefic.

If there is a planet in the Lagna, then the season typified by

planet in the Lagna, then it is with reference to the strongest
planet. If there is no planet in the Lagna, it is only in that case
that the season should be predicted with reference to the planet

general rule is laid down by
-
Satyacharya! Vis.,
सुहृदस्त्रिकोणभवनाद्वहस्य सुतमें व्ययेऽथ धनभवने ।

Planets are friendly to any given planet when they happen to
own the 5th, 12th, 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 9th houses counted from the
planet's Moolatrikona Rasi, or when they happen to own the
planet's exaltation Rasi. The rest are his enemies.
Place the planet in its Moolatrikona and mark the 2nd, 12th,
5th, 9th, the planet's exaltation Rasi, the 8th and the 10th. Planets
twice invited become friends; planets once invited become
acquaintances and planets that are uninvited become enemies. But
the Sun and the Moon become friends on a single invitation (as)
each owns only a single sign in the Zodiac).
The Sun invites Mars twice, Jupiter twice, the Moon once and
Mercury once. Venus and Saturn are uninvited. Therefore Mars,

राहस्तु मित्राणि कवीज्यमंदाः केतोस्तथैवात्र वदन्ति तज्ज्ञाः ॥
द्वयोः सुहृत्वं त्वतिमित्रता भवेद्विधारयस्ते तु सदातिशत्रवः ।
सुहृत्समत्वं सुहृदेव केवलं रिपुः समारिस्त्वरिमित्रतासमः ॥ ४६ ॥
Sloka. 46. If there is friendliness both naturally
and temporarily on the part of a planet, he is a great
friend. Those that are enemies both ways are deadly
foes invariably. That planet is but a friend which has
the character of being friendly and neutral from the two
points of view, while the one which has the character
of being neutral and inmical is an enemy. A planet
that is inimical in the one case and friendly in the other
is to be taken as neutral.

Sloka. 47. Sages say that the Sun is steadfast ; the
Moon is wandering ( unsteady ); Mars is violent; Mer-
cury has a mixture of diverse qualities; Jupiter is gentle;
Venus is light or easy and Saturn is harsh.

Sloka. 48. In the case of moveable, immoveable
and dual signs, planets occupying respectively the 11th,
9th and the 7th houses from them or their lords will
prove exceedingly troublesome planets if they happen to
own at the same time the houses occupied by the lord
of Khara (ख़र ) or Mandi ( मान्दि).

Sicka. 49. A person ought to divine about his
own self, father, influence, health, vigour and fortune
from the Sun. It is the Moon that determines the
character of one's heart, understanding, royal favour,
mother and affluence. It is through Mars that a person
can ascertain his own courage, disease, characteristic
qualities, younger brother, lands, foes and blood-
(parternal) relations. It is Mercury that: influences one's
learning, relatives in general, discrimination, maternal
uncle, friends, speech and action.

Stoka. 50. One ought to conjecture about one's
own genius, wealth, physical development, sons anj
knowledge by referring to Jupiter. Information regarding
one's wife, vehicles, ornaments, love affairs and
pleasures is to be sought through Venus. It is Saturn
that settles a person's period of life, livelihood, the
cause of death, his adversity and prosperity. One
ought to guess about one's paternal grand father through
Rahu and about the maternal grandfather through Ketu.

should, in view to allay all such diseases, propitiate the
lord of the irritated constituents in question, by means
of prayers, libations of water, oblations (thrown in the
fire) and by liberal gifts. When their minds are by
these means freed from apprehensions of disease and
sorrow, they will become possessed of health, happiness
fame and strength.

Sloka. 84. In an odd sign, according to the num-
ber of degrees advanced, a planet is said to be in infancy,
in boyhood, in adolescence, in advanced age and in
extremis. But in an even sign, these several divisions
have to be again made regularly in the reverse order.

positions. An accurate knowledge of these appears to be very
essential for making correct predictions. It has often been seen
that, in the case of 2 or more persons born at one and the same
time (say in the same Lagna, in the same day, month and year),
the phalas or effects are not at all similar but quite different.
This is mostly due to the entire change in their Avasthas (:) in
which the planets are situated in these horoscopes. For instance,
one ought to naturally expect Santhanavriddhi ( सन्तानवृद्धि) if a
benefic planet occupies the 5th house and Puthranasa ( पुत्रनाश) if a
malefic one should occupy the same. But it is stated that benefic
planets in the Cheshta (चेष्टा ) state in the Sayana (शयन) and Nidra
Avasthas (निद्रा अवस्था) occupying the 5th house do more harm thau
good for progeny, while malefics in the same position and in the
same conditions are capable of helping the Santhanavriddhi
( सन्तान वृद्धि) of the native As the several Avasthas (अवस्थ: : ) of the
planets are thus seen to play a very important part in moulding
the nature of their effects during any birth, a detailed description
of the same here will not be considered out of place.

Six varieties have formerly been declared, by Sambhu regard-
ing the conditions of planets, vizl, ( 1 ) Lajjitha लज्जित ashamed or
ahashed, ( 2 ) Garvitha - गर्वित ( haughty or conceited ), ( 3 ) Kshudhitha-
क्षुक्ति ( hungry ), ( 4 ) Thrushitha - तृषित (thirsty or greedy ), ( 5 ) Muditha-
मुदित (pleased or delighted) and ( 6 ) Kshobhitha - क्षाभित ( agitated or
excitei).
(i) A planet is said to be in a Lajjitha-condition when
it occupies the 5th house in conjunction with Rahu, Ketu, the Sun,
Saturn or Mars.
(ii) It is said to be Garvitha when it is in its exaltation
position or in its Moolatrhikona.
(iii) It is in a Kshudhitha-ga state when it occupies an
inimical house or is in conjunction with Saturn or an inimical
planet or aspected by an inimical planet.
(iv) If the planet being in a watery sign be at the same time
aspected by an inimical planet and unaspected by benefic ones.
it is said to be in a Thrushitha state.
(v) But if it occupies a friend's house and be in conjunction
with a friendly planet, or Jupiter or be aspected by another friend-
ly planet, it is in a Muditha condition?
(vi) Lastly, its condition will be Kshobitha
when
it is eclipsed by the Sun and has on it the aspect of malefics or
that of an inimical planet,

There are twelve other conditions of planets which have also
to be specially noticed. Thev in their order are (1) Sayana शयन
( lying down ), ( 2 ) Upavesa उपवेश ( sitting ), ( 3 ) Nethrapani नेवपाणि
(with the hand on the eye ), ( 4 ) Prakasana प्रकाशन (making bright or
irradiating ) (5) Gamanechcha गमनेच्छा (desire to g0), (6) Gamang गमन
( going), (7) Sabhayam Vasati सभायां वसति ( dwelling or being in an
assembly), (8) Agama आगन (coming), (9) भोजन ( eating), (10) Nrutra-
lipsa नृत्यलिप्सा (desire to dance ) ( 11 ) Kauthuka कौतुक ( delight joy,
pleasure) and ( 12 ) Nidra निद्रा (sleep).
To find the particular of any planet, the following is
the method to be adopted:-


============================================================

============================================================

T. 88

Find the product of the following three numbers:--
(1) The number representing the order of the planet (counted
from the Sun whose Avastha- has to be found. (2) the
number representing the order of the Nakshatra (counted from
Aswini) in which the planet is situated; and (3) the number
representing the actual degree in which the planet is at the time
under consideration. To this product must be added (1) the number
Indicating the order of the person's Janma Nakshatra
(2) the
number representing the order of the Jananalagna (counted
From Mesha) and (3) the number representing the ghatikas that
have elapsed since Sunrise till the time of birth. Divide the re-
Sult by 12. The remainder will indicate the order of the Avastha
अवस्था (counted from शयन) of the planet.
Again, multiply the remainder above obtained by itself. To
this add the number given in the marginally noted table under the
initial letter of the name of the person concerned. Divide the re-
sult by 12. To the remainder add the Kshepa-, which is also
appended in the margin, belonging
to the planet, and divide this by 3.
The remainder will indicate in
which of the three-Drishti, Che-
shta or Vicheshta - दृष्टि, चेटा, or विचेष्टा
conditions in the Avastha-sraem
already found, the planet actually
is at the time.
Take for example the case of
the horoscope given in the notes
श्रीपतिपद्धति.
to Gripathipaddhathi
"
Suppose it is required to find the
particular Avasthaan of Jupi-
ter. The birth is stated to be at
half a ghatika before Sunrise or
in the 60th ghatika from the pre-
vious Sunrise. The position of
Jupiter is 8 signs, 1 degree, 25
minutes, 1 second. Jupiter is ip

the star Moola-, and in the 2nd degree of Dhanus. Jupiter
is the 5th when counted from the Sun. Moɔlaчis the 19th
from Aswini - अश्विनी.
Therefore multiplying 5× 19 × 2=190.
To this must be added the number represented by the Janana-
lagna- (which is Mesha- in this horoscope), the number
representing the Janmanakshatra (which is Sravana-
or 22nd from Aswini-ft) and the number representing the gha-
tikas that have elapsed since last Sunrise (which is 60 in the pre-
sent case).
"
The result is 190+1+22+60 or 273. Dividing this by 12,
we have 9 as the remainder which means that Jupiter's Avastha-
अवस्था at the time is Bhojana - भोजन.
Again squaring 9, we get 81. The name of the native begins
with the letter & and the number given for that letter is 1. So we
have 81 +1 or 82. Dividing this by 12, there is remainder 10.
To this must be added the Kshepa- of Jupiter, viz. 5. Total is
therefore 15. When this is divided by 3, there is a remainder 3
which means that Jupiter is in Vicheshta-in the Bhojana
• Avasthaभोजनावस्था.
The following table shows the particular Avastha;
and
the sub-state or condition therein in which the several planets are
laced in the horoscope under reference.

of the period of life influenced by him. But the same
planet in a Prishtodaya sign does it at the final stage.
But if he should be in a sign which has both the charac
